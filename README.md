# simulating-particles-in-a-box

Both files, particlesinabox-classical.py and particlesinabox-quantum.py, use classical mechanics to compute the change in momentum of a particle-particle collision, however, particlesinabox-quantum.py adds an element of randomness to the final velocities of a two-particle collision by randomizing the angles of the particles' velocity vectors post-collision.
